# BackgroundFox

Firefox for Android extension.

Loads YouTube videos in a simplified player that keeps audio working in the background if you switch tab or app.

## Supporting repo

See also [backgroundfox-embedder](https://github.com/webful-ltd/backgroundfox-embedder) which enables the videos to be embedded and makes this work.

This uses a separate site to allow for improvements on the embed page without requiring an extension update every time.
